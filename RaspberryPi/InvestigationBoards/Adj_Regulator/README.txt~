Raspberry PI Controlled Adjustable Voltage Regulator

This circuit uses a digital potentiometer to control the voltage output from a
switched mode power supply. The circuit also has a current and voltage feedback,
so that the user can (through software) achieve either a constant-voltage or
constant current power supply. There is also a temperature sensor on the board,
opposite the regulator so the user can monitor the regulator temperature. 

This board uses:

  *  One Wire Bus
  *  i2c Bus
  *  SPI Bus

Software will be added once the board is built. Once this project has been tested
and revised to remove bugs, it will not be developed any further.
