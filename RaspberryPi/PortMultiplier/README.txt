Raspberry PI Port Multiplier

This project is primarily to test a range of technologies, prior to thier use in other projects. These are:

  *  One Wire Bus
  *  i2c Bus for ADC and DIO
  *  i2C Multiplexing
  *  Variable switching PSU
  *  Breakout for SPI

Once this project has been tested and revised to remove bugs, it will not be developed any further.

All I/O lines on this board are 3v3 ONLY. Do not connect to 5 volt logic without suitable interfacing. No input protection or filtering is provided on the board, this is purely a proof of concept design.
